# 200 to Texas

This is a personal project that is being created for a Tumblr theme. I want to eventually transfer the site over to using Jekyll hosted on github but until then I am going the route of Tumblr.

Since this project is going to carry on over 200 days I will continue to update the code to make it work on as may browsers as possible. I will purposly not be support some browsers like older versions of IE. Additionally, many of the features in my CSS are experimental modules and will break in non-webkit browsers. Everything is being optimized for Safari.
